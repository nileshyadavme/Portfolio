When you build a table, you don't start by gluing pieces together. You plan the joints, consider the grain direction, and account for wood movement over time.

Software architecture is remarkably similar. If you don't plan your interfaces (the joints), consider the data flow (the grain), and account for changing requirements (wood movement), your application will eventually crack under pressure.

Here are three principles from the woodshop that I apply to my codebase every day.
